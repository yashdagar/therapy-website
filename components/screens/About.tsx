                About Dr. Serena Blake, PsyD
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Finding meaningful support in times of stress, anxiety, or emotional upheaval can be a transformative experience. 
                I view therapy as a collaborative space where you can begin to make sense of your thoughts and experiences, 
                identify recurring patterns, and move toward healing and growth. My approach emphasizes both structure and 
                flexibilityâ€”drawing from evidence-based modalities like cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and trauma-informed care, 
                while tailoring the work to meet your unique needs.<br /><br />

                I&quot;m Dr. Serena Blake, a licensed clinical psychologist based in Los Angeles, California. Over the past eight years, 
                I&quot;ve had the privilege of working with individuals across more than 500 therapy sessions. Whether we&quot;re focusing on managing anxiety, 
                building healthier relationships, or addressing the lasting impacts of trauma, I strive to offer a space grounded in respect, compassion, 
                and professional integrity.<br /><br />

                Therapy with me is available both in-person at my office on Maplewood Drive or virtually through secure Zoom sessions. In either setting, 
                my priority is to create a safe, trusting environment where meaningful change can take place.<br /><br />
                Whether you meet in her Maplewood Drive office or connect virtually via Zoom, Dr. Blake is committed to creating a safe, supportive space 
                for you to thrive.
